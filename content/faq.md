## What are the volunteer expectations for each family?

Swim and Dive families must volunteer at a minimum of 3 meets unless they are on the Board or a Chair. Water Polo families are required to volunteer at 2 meets. Families who do not meet this obligation will be assessed an additional $100. Sign-ups will be emailed before each meet. Please [email the board](mailto:fmhswaterjags@gmail.com) if you have any questions.
