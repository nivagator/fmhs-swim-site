LEWISVILLE--- The Flower Mound girls swim and dive team found themselves in a familiar place, announced as Region 2-6A champions for the third year in a row, at the Lewisville ISD Westside Aquatic Center on Saturday afternoon.

They totaled 525 points for the meet with Allen placing second with 270 and Prosper placed third with 201.

Flower Mound received 60 points for having four athletes in the Girls 200-yard individual medley. It was Allen’s Katelynn Zhou (2:02.90) who took first, but Parker Kruzel (second, 2:06.50), McKennah Greer (third, 2:06.79), Eva Lofthus (fifth, 2:08.73), and Cassidy Masters (sixth, 2:09.36) all brought home Lady Jagur points for the event.

The girls’ 100 butterfly saw another 53 points go to Flower Mound. Kruzel (57.01), Masters (57.58), and Ananya Gupta (58.34) took first, second, and third for the event, respectively.

“We came in to today positioned real well in our events,” said Tony Arbogast, Flower Mound head coach. “We talked before, hold your spot, go out there and swim your race, let the cards fall where they may. At least you can walk out of here head held high saying you tried your best, let the placings take care of themselves. It worked out well.”

On the men’s side, Dallas Jesuit took first with 334 points. Flower Mound placed second with 263, narrowly beating Allen, who took third with 253.

The Lady Jaguars took no time to start racking up the points. In the 200 medley relay, the team of Clair Uliasz, Greer, Kruzel and Laney Weiland won the heat with a time of 1:46.58. Prosper and Allen rounded out the top three.

“This was their third year being region champions,” Arbogast said. “I think that was a driving force … let’s keep it going, same on the boys side. We were top two last year, it’s just wanting to keep that sustained success and get as many kids to that next step [state] as possible.

The boys took the event for Flower Mound as well, with Luke Garrett, Dallas Jones, Jerry Teng and Aubrey Jaya finishing in 1:34.04. Allen and Plano finished in second and third.

Prosper gained valuable points by winning the girls’ 400 freestyle relay. Addison Johnson, Georgia Wimberly, Kensie Albrecht and Ava Goodwill finished with a time of 3:34.30. Flower Mound took second with 3:35.57.

Marcus (3:09.10) and Coppell (3:09.63) took second and third in the boys’ iteration of that race.

Prosper took the 200 freestyle for the girls. Wimberly (1:52.44) won the heat with Flower Mound’s Uliasz (1:54.49) shortly behind.

In the boys 200 freestyle, Flower Mound’s Jaya took first (1:12.73) and Marcus sophomore Hudson Roybal (1:13.82) finished second.

The boys 100 breaststroke saw another Jaguar win, with Jones (55.82) narrowly beating Coppell’s Gabriel Campos (56.36).

The Class 6A state meet will take place Feb. 21-22 at the Lee and Joe Jamall Texas Swimming Center in Austin.
