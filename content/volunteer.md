### Family Expectations
Swim and Dive families must volunteer at a minimum of 3 meets unless they are on the Board or a Chair. Water Polo families are required to volunteer at 2 meets. Families who do not meet this obligation will be assessed an additional $100.

Sign-ups will be emailed out a week before each meet and posted to this page when available.
